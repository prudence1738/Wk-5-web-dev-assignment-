# Mastering JavaScript Fundamentals

Welcome to my **JavaScript Fundamentals** project! ðŸš€  

This repository contains a hands-on assignment designed to strengthen my understanding of core JavaScript concepts including **variables, data types, operators, conditionals, functions, loops, and DOM manipulation**.  

## Project Overview

The project is divided into four main parts:  

1. **JavaScript Basics**  
   - Captures user input and makes decisions using `if/else`.  
   - Demonstrates understanding of how JavaScript processes logic and interacts with data.  

2. **JavaScript Functions**  
   - Includes at least two custom functions that process inputs and return results.  
   - Focuses on code reusability and the DRY principle (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself).  

3. **JavaScript Loops**  
   - Uses `for` and `while` loops to iterate over arrays and perform repetitive tasks.  
   - Demonstrates control flow with repetition.  

4. **DOM Manipulation**  
   - Dynamically updates webpage content using JavaScript.  
   - Handles user interactions such as button clicks and text updates.  

## Files in This Repository

- `index.html` â€” structured HTML content for the assignment.  
- `style.css` â€” optional styling for the webpage.  
- `script.js` â€” JavaScript code containing all variables, functions, loops, and DOM interactions.  

## Learning Outcomes

- Strong understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.  
- Ability to write reusable functions and control program flow with loops.  
- Experience manipulating the DOM to make static pages interactive.  
- Organized, well-commented code following best practices.
